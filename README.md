Based on the Platinum theme

A clone of the old Macintosh System ~6 Desktop, with a few stylistic changes.

---------

- Put this folder right in your ~/.themes folder.

- The ./resources folder contains the Chicago font, obtained from https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/ClassicMacintoshFonts (a cool guy)

- The lemonbar script needs a lemonbar with the borders patch to have its border. I think lemonbar may come with default xft support, but you'll probably need that, too.
